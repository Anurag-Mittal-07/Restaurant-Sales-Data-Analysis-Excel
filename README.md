## Overview-
This project is about analysing sales data from a restaurant over three months, from January to March 2023. I've collected information on customer orders and menu items.

## Dataset Description-
1.	restaurant_db_data_dictionary - This file explains what each part of our data means
2.	menu_items - This table shows the different items on our menu, along with their prices and categories.
3.	order_details - This table gives details about each order, including when it was placed and what items were ordered.

## Dashboard Features
This dashboard helps to understand how the restaurant is doing by showing:
1.	Total sales
2.	Dishes served.
3.	Tables served.
4.	Average order per table

## Charts and Insights
I created several charts to help us make decisions:
1.	Sales by food category
2.	Sales by day of the week
3.	Number of orders over time
4.	Most popular food categories
5.	Monthly sales
6.	Popular food items

Dashboard Interactivity
Interaction with the dashboard can be made using slicers like:
1.	Day of the week
2.	Meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
3.	Month
4.	Order date
